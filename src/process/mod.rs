//! Everything a service or task does for itself: the supervisors that own
//! processes from prepare to reap, the spawn/stop machinery they drive, the
//! health monitor, ready resolution, and the vocabulary they speak.
//!
//! The edge is deliberate and greppable: **this module imports nothing from
//! `crate::runner`.** Processes produce reports; the runner folds them and
//! decides what starts next. Commands flow down, reports flow up, and the
//! scheduler never reaches into an process's internals.
